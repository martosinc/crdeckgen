# CR Decks Generator
Generating Clash Royale Decks using RNN

### Usage
Now there's a [website](https://crdeckgen.herokuapp.com/) with the program functionality!
Just click the Generate button and it will redirect you to deckshop.com.

#### By hand
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/martosinc/crdeckgen`
2. run `python ClashRoyale.py` in the directory
3. The programm will give you 10 links to deckshop.com with the generated decks

Most of the time the program gives you really good decks(2-3 Godly, sometimes 4), even with this small database. Sometimes though returnes the same deck twice or more.

Also you can experiement with the network in the notebook `ClashRoyale.ipynb`

### TODO
1. Larger deck database
